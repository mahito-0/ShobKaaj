# ShoobKaj
Bangladesh’s inclusive platform for finding and hiring local workers.

🛠️ ShobKaaj – Smart Job Marketplace

ShobKaaj is a digital job marketplace designed to connect clients with local workers across Bangladesh. Unlike global platforms (TaskRabbit, Upwork, Fiverr) that focus on niche work, or local platforms (Bdjobs, Sheba.xyz, Kormo Jobs) that are limited to single categories, ShobKaaj provides a unified solution for both formal and informal employment.

🌟 Key Features

📍 GPS-based Matching – Find nearby workers and job opportunities in real time.

💬 In-App Chat – Seamless communication between clients and workers.

💳 Mobile Payment Integration – Secure transactions with local payment systems.

✅ Verified Profiles & Ratings – Build trust with worker verification and reviews.

🌐 Bangla-First, Multilingual Support – Easy access for all users, urban and rural.

🛠️ Multi-Category Jobs – From skilled labor to household services and freelancing.

🎯 Why ShobKaaj?

Bangladesh has many workers in the informal sector who are often left out of digital platforms. ShobKaaj bridges this gap by creating an inclusive platform that empowers workers, supports local communities, and makes hiring simple, secure, and transparent.
